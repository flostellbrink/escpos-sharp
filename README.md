# EscPosSharp

Based on [https://github.com/anastaciocintra/escpos-coffee](https://github.com/anastaciocintra/escpos-coffee)

.NET library for ESC/POS printer commands. Can send text, images and barcodes to the printer.
All commands are sent to one Stream, then you can redirect to printer, file or network.

> [!WARNING]  
> Tests indicate that ordered dithering is not working. Not using that myself, open for PRs.
